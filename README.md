We are looking at bots. We're not great at coding, and so we will use some frameworkd -- probably Claudia at this point -- while looking at others. Our main thing is the documentation and the chatbot scripts. 

Sometime soon then I'll have the Claudia forked over here and working on it so we can get it running... I believe on Amazon's place -- or Googles. Not sure yet. We haven't got that far.
